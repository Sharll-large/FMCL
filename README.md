## Making Minecraft launcher, you can do it too!

The FMCL core(src/core) doesn't rely on the GUI module. So, you can use the core in your project easily.  
Therefore, we are committed to making the code more understandable, so there may be frequent refactoring. Refactoring
will have a significant impact on the code, so we do not recommend using the core to create your own launcher until the
official version is released.  
The MIT License has been used. So you're highly free to use the core.
`The usage of core is on writing.`

## Download This Program
